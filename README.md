DATACENTER CMS APPLICATION
==================

Data Center Application is built on the codeigniter mvc platform. 

Main features are being able to run websites with lots of data without
a database using json/xml based data streams. 

Data is stored in a database on the cms side that then publishes json/xml files
so websites/applications can have localized data already loaded that are able to
be searched fast and loaded quickly. 

This allows applications and websites the ability to go "offline". 

This is still in the building mode with the intentions of going live free to
the public and extendable to anyone that wants to use it.

The DataCenter app is developed by Jeremy Davis of the DevNinjas team.
